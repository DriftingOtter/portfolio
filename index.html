          <h2><i>Hello~</i></h2> 

          <p id="intro">
          My name is Daksh Kaul, and I'm an espiring <b>software developer
          /writer/musican</b> that specializes in back-end development.
          </p>

          <p>
          I believe that code should do its job, and not an
          ounce more, or less.
          </p>

          <p id="ethos">
          The beauty in simplicity is one of my core ethos
          when it comes to developing. I believe that if
          an application/service/website can deliver its
          information to the user in the fastest and simplicest 
          way possible, without any 'fuzz' or 'fluff' that 
          may make the spreading of information harder or 
          long-winded, it's truely a wonderful creation.
          </p>

          <p>
          To boast these princiles I honed my skills in the
          following programming languages, distrobutions, and 
          version control systems:
          </p>

          <ul id="skills">
              <li> Python       </li>
              <li> C/C++        </li>
              <li> Rust         </li>
              <li> SQL          </li>
              <li> HTML/CSS/JS* </li>
          <hr>
              <li> Git/Github                       </li> 
              <li> Word/Powerpoint/Excel            </li>
              <li> Linux: OpenSUSE TW, Arch, Ubuntu </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
          Not only have I burnt the midnight oil in my
          chosen field of expertise, I have also concurrently
          worked hard in culturing my knowledge of the greather
          academia.
          </p>

          <p>
          During my stay in high school within the IB 
          (International Baccalaureate) program I studied:
          </p>

          <ul id="education">
              <li> Physics             </li>
              <li> Statisics           </li>
              <li> English Composition </li>
              <li> Spanish             </li>
              <li> Computer Science    </li>
              <li> Digital Humanities (Digital Society) </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
          With this combined knoweldge, I have developed many
          personal projects which display my equipped-ness 
          for not only many 'small-scale' projects, but also
          'full stack' applications which can scale to large
          quantites of userbases.
          </p>

          <h3 id='accomplishments'>smplfetch</h3>
          <hr>
          A straighforward system info fetch script for Linux, 
          which includes commonly used information for the user 
          to display for debugging or 'astheic' purposes.

          <h3>brsk</h3>
          <hr>
          brsk (pronounced: brisk), is a Linux shell written
          in Rust. As this is my current personal project, 
          it is still in heavy alpha stages. But some of 
          the final features will be: command parsing &
          execution, IO redirection, parralel processing,
          enviornment management, command subsitution, scripting
          capabilities - utilizing a hand-rolled shell scripting
          language - and 'plugin extensibility'.

          <h3>ShowMyKeys</h3>
          <hr>
          A keyboard visualizor/emulation software that can
          be utilized for displaying keyboard combinations.

          <h3>Typr</h3>
          <hr>
          Typr is an interactive touch typing learning application 
          designed to improve your typing skills and prevent RSI
          (Repetitive Stain Injury) by incrementally teaching each
          'layer' of the keyboard via 'bit-sized' lessons to build
          mastery of the standard keyboard QWERTY layout.
